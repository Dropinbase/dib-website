            <ul>
            <li><b>2.1.</b> We track your information using cookies, or small text files which include an anonymous unique identifier. Cookies are sent to a User's web browser from our servers and are stored on the User's computer hard drive. Sending a cookie to a User's web browser enables us to collect Non-Personal information about the particular User and keep a record of the User's preferences when utilizing our Services, both on an individual and aggregate basis. The Company may use both persistent and session cookies; persistent cookies remain on your computer after you close your session and until you delete them, while session cookies expire when you close your browser.</li>
            <li><b>2.2.</b> Essential Cookies</li>
            <ul>
            <li><b>2.2.1.</b> These cookies are essential for the basic functionalities offered by our Website and the products offered through our Website. This class of cookies helps in keeping an User logged in to the Website service and helps remember relevant information when they return to the Website service.</li>
            </ul>
            <li><b>2.3.</b> Preferential Cookies</li>
            <ul>
            <li><b>2.3.1.</b> Functional and/or preferential cookies enable us to recall your selections (such as username, language, or region) and additional functionalities (such as managing the cookie banner, redirection to another page) to offer a more tailored online experience. These preferences are retained (via persistent cookies) to eliminate the need for reconfiguration upon subsequent visits to the page.</li>
            </ul>
            <li><b>2.4.</b> Insight Cookies</li>
            <ul>
            <li><b>2.4.1.</b> These cookies are used for tracking the User's activities within the Service, which in turn helps us in improving the User's experience. We partner with third parties to capture how you use and interact with our Website through various kinds of analytic softwares such as Google Analytics, to improve our products and/or services.</li>
            </ul>
            <li><b>2.5.</b> Marketing Cookies</li>
            <ul>
            <li><b>2.5.1.</b> We also use some marketing cookies provided by third parties to collect and analyze various information about the visitors to the Dropinbase Website and Users of the Website. No personal or intrusive information is collected in this process though.</li>
            </ul>
            <li><b>2.6.</b> Third Party Cookies</li>
            <ul>
            <li><b>2.6.1.</b> A third-party cookie originates from a domain different from the one you are currently visiting (e.g., cookies set by google.com on https://dropinbase.com/). While some of Dropinbase services may be hosted on third-party domains, our commitment to privacy remains consistent across all domains.</li>
            <li><b>2.6.2.</b> Dropinbase strictly prohibits third-party tracking companies from setting cookies or other trackers on our Website to safeguard User privacy. However, when embedding third-party hosted content on our Website, the third-party may set cookies on your browser for intended service purposes (e.g., bandwidth management, language preference storage, tracking consent, and anonymous statistical data collection). Whenever feasible, we prioritize privacy-friendly options such as privacy mode and anonymous statistics only, to ensure User privacy. Nonetheless, some aspects of embedded content may not be entirely within our control, including the ability to unilaterally manage cookies set by these third parties upon loading of the Website's webpage.</li>
            </ul>
            <li><b>2.7.</b> Management of Cookies</li>
            <ul>
            <li><b>2.7.1.</b> Many browsers offer settings preferences to manage cookies. However, restricting the Website from setting cookies could potentially diminish your user experience by removing personalization features. It may also prevent you from saving customized settings such as login information. In case of the Subdomain, you must allow all cookies in order to sign-in to the Subdomain and to maintain a consistent and secure session state. Browser manufacturers typically provide guidance on managing cookies within their products.</li>
            </ul></ul>
            <h3><b>3.</b> IS THE INFORMATION DISCLOSED?</h3>
            <ul>
            <li><b>3.1.</b> We are not in the business of selling your information. We consider this information to be a vital part of our relationship with you.
