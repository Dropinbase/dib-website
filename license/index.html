          <h3 style="text-align: center">INTRODUCTION</h3>
          <div style="text-align: left;">
  
              Welcome to Dropinbase, a flexible and highly agile low-code platform for database application development and prototyping.
              <br><br>
              
              <b>Note, this introduction acts only as an convenient overview of the essential elements of the licensing agreement. 
              <br>For a complete understanding, please read the full Agreement.</b>
  
              <ul class="introlist">
                  <li>The Dropinbase platform is provided under a license, not sold.</li>
                  <li>Each application being developed must be registered using the facility on the Dashboard, immediately after the installation of Dropinbase.</li>
                  <li>Registration gives each application a unique applicationId which is recorded in the Dropinbase database settings table and facilitates  the subscription fee tracking. You agree to ensure that each unique application has a unique applicationId as obtainable from Dropinbase and not to maliciously tamper with any mechanism related to payment.</li>
                  <li>The subscription fee is due after the first two months, irrespective of whether the application is used in production yet, unless the application is discontinued (see below).</li>
                  <li>All development, testing, staging, and the first production installation of the application must share the same applicationId, resulting in a single subscription fee for a particular application.</li>
                  <li>A subscription fee is due for every production installation of the same application. Ie. each production installation must have a different applicationId.</li>
                  <li>You can discontinue an application to avoid subscription fees after the first two free months, by signing-in at the https://portal.dropinbase.com.</li>
                  <li>Once an application is discontinued, further development or use is not allowed.</li>
              </ul>
  
              Subscription fees are waived in the following scenarios:
              <ul class="introlist">
              <li>Applications with no more than 10 containers (containers provided by Dropinbase are free).</li>
              <li>Applications used internally by employees of non-profits.</li>
              <li>Applications used internally by employees of startups with an annual revenue of less than $30,000.</li>
              <li>Applications used internally by employees and students of registered educational institutions like schools, colleges or universities.</li>
              <li>Applications solely for personal use, which is not income generating.
              <li>Applications purposed solely for learning to use Dropinbase or PHP.</li>
              </ul>
              The Dropinbase core framework may be modified for internal use only and must not be rebranded or publicly distributed.<br>
              The Dropinbase platform is intended for lawful and ethical uses and must not be employed in any way that harms individuals or the environment.<br>
              We strive to keep subscription fees affordable to support a diverse user base while maintaining and enhancing Dropinbase and fostering a supportive community.<br> 
              Please join and participate in our community. We trust you will find the give-and-receive journey as rewarding as we do.<br><br>

              <li><b>2.1.</b> This Agreement is versioned according to the Semantic Versioning model, which follows the format MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH (see http://semver.org/). This model defines how version numbers are assigned and incremented for the Agreement, ensuring clear communication of changes and updates to DIB Users.</li>
              </ul>

              <ul>
              <li><b>3.1.</b> This Agreement encompasses or may be modified to encompass copies, downloads, installations, and upgrades of official versions of the DIB Platform. You are hereby prohibited under the terms of this Agreement and under the Intellectual Property Rights of the Republic of South Africa and/or from the Intellectual Property Rights from your home country from relocating, deleting, obscuring, or renaming the file containing the Agreement or its contents and non-compliance of this clause 3.1.

              </ul>
              <h3><b>4.</b> PAYMENTS</h3>
              <ul>
              <li><b>4.1.</b> THE DIB PLATFORM IS LICENSABLE IN NATURE AND NOTHING IN THIS AGREEMENT SHALL CONSTRUE THAT THE DIB PLATFORM IS FOR SALE.</li>
              <li><b>4.2.</b> You agree to pay one subscription fee per DIB Application, which covers any number of development, testing or staging installations of the application, but only one production installation. It also includes any amount of end-users of the single DIB Application. You agree to register each DIB Application through our User Portal, using the buttons and links provided on the DIB Software dashboard or on the User Portal at https://portal.dropinbase.com. Registration results in an applicationId that is stored in the settings table of the Dropinbase installation, and is used to identify the DIB Application. All development, testing, staging, and the first production installation of the DIB Application must share the same applicationId, resulting in a single subscription fee. If the same DIB Application is installed multiple times for different sets of end-users, each installation must be registered separately and is subject to payment for the subscription fee. Bulk licenses can be purchased in packs of more than 20 - please contact us at sales@dropinbase.com for more info.</li>
              <li><b>4.3.</b> Each DIB Application comes with a complimentary usage period of two (2) months. To avoid incurring charges after this period, irrespective of whether the application is used in production yet, you must change the status of the registered DIB Application to 'discontinued' before the end of the two(2)-month period, by logging into the online User Portal.</li>
              <li><b>4.4.</b> A DIB Application that is set to 'discontinued' must not be used or further developed in any capacity. If its status is changed back to 'active', the subscription fee will become payable again. Note that the subscription fee expiry date is extended for each month that the DIB Application has the 'discontinued' status.</li>
              <li><b>4.5.</b> Subscription fees for the DIB Application can be paid on a monthly, semi-annual (six (6) monthly), or annual (twelve (12) monthly) basis. These fees are designed to be both affordable and ensure that Dropinbase can support the community, release new features, upgrade Angular and PHP code, enhance performance and security, and create documentation and examples.</li>
              <li><b>4.6.</b> The subscription fee due is displayed on the official Dropinbase website, at https://www.dropinbase.com/pricing and/or the user portal at https://portal.dropinbase.com, and/or at any other part of the main website or its subdomains, as may be displayed and included or modified in this Agreement. In addition it may be displayed on the dashboard of the registered DIB Application.</li>
              <li><b>4.7.</b> Each installation of the DIB Software with more than five hundred (500) containers (where this count excludes the count of Free Containers) will incur additional fees. These additional fees are kept affordable and are assessed on a case-by-case basis. Please contact us at billing@dropinbase.com to discuss the applicable fees for such instances.</li>

              <li><b>4.9.</b> Note, in the future Dropinbase may switch to a new fee structure based on the number of containers you use (excluding any Free Containers). This change is intended to create a more equitable pricing system. The new fee structure will only apply to new DIB Applications registered after we provide notice of the change. If you registered your DIB Application before the notice is given, you will continue to pay under the fixed fee structure. However, if the new container-based fee structure would result in a lower fee for your DIB Application, then we will automatically switch it to the new structure.</li>
